/**
 * The profile control in the header.
 *
 * ## Why it took the wishlist's place
 *
 * The heart was one saved list behind a permanent slot in the header. Everything
 * an account holds — purchases, addresses, cards, and the resale flow that runs
 * off a purchase — had nowhere to live at all. The wishlist is not gone; it is
 * the first item in this menu, which is a demotion it earns: a saved list is one
 * of the things an account is for, not the only one.
 *
 * ## A menu, not a route
 *
 * It opens in place. Every destination in here is a page, but the *chooser*
 * should not cost a navigation — a shopper opening the profile mid-browse to
 * check an order should not lose the listing they were on. The same reasoning as
 * the bag drawer beside it.
 *
 * Closes on Escape, on an outside click, and on navigation — that last one for
 * the same reason the bag drawer does it: every item in here leaves the page,
 * and a menu left hanging over the destination hides what was asked for.
 *
 * ## Purchases sit at the top, and say why
 *
 * They are the entry point to resale — the only legitimate one, since a listing
 * has to start from something you actually bought. The item carries that as its
 * own line of copy rather than leaving "Sell something" as an orphan action
 * elsewhere in the menu with no route into it.
