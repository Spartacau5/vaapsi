/**
 * The journey line.
 *
 * Still the emotional centre of the product, and still typographic rather than
 * iconographic — no icons per event type, no coloured stages, no progress bar. A
 * garment's life is not a checkout funnel and it has no completion percentage.
 *
 * ## What was cut, and why
 *
 * Each event was rendering five stacked lines: label, date, actor, note, and an
 * italic sentence saying how we knew. On an eight-event chain that is forty lines
 * of text, and the fifth line was the worst offender — *"Stated by the owner at
 * intake"* appeared three times on one passport, so the repetition trained the
 * eye to skip exactly the field that carries the honesty.
 *
 * Now: **label, date, actor**, plus the note only when there is one. How we know
 * is carried by the **provenance mark on the rail**, which is already labelled
 * for assistive tech and already the site's established vocabulary for
 * confidence. The verification sentences are collected once, under the line, in a
 * disclosure — said properly in one place instead of badly in eight.
 *
 * That is roughly a 40% reduction in text with no loss of information, and the
 * shape of the garment's life is now legible at a glance.
