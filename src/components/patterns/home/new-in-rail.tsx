/**
 * Horizontally scrolling rail of recent arrivals.
 *
 * Native scroll with snap points underneath, so a trackpad, a touchscreen and a
 * scrollbar all work without us writing a single line for them. The arrows sit
 * on top of that rather than replacing it: they call `scrollBy`, the browser
 * animates it and the snap points catch the result. Nothing here reimplements
 * scrolling, which is what makes a carousel feel wrong on a laptop.
 *
 * The arrows exist because on a desktop with no touchscreen a horizontal rail is
 * genuinely awkward — shift-scroll is not something most people know, and a
 * scrollbar under a row of images is not an inviting control. They disable at
 * each end rather than wrapping: this is a scroll position, not a carousel, and
 * a rail that silently jumps back to the start loses the reader's place.
 *
 * The overflow bleeds to the viewport edge so a partially visible card signals
 * that there is more — a rail that ends flush at the gutter looks like a grid
 * that ran out.
 *
 * The scrollbar is hidden. That is only safe because the arrows are there: a
 * scrolling region with no visible control and no scrollbar strands anyone who
 * cannot swipe. Native scrolling itself is untouched.
 *
 * The note under the heading does real work: it says out loud that these are
 * one-of-one, which is what makes a rail of resale stock feel like rotating
 * inventory rather than a catalogue.
 *
 * A client component, for the ref and the scroll position. `ProductCard` renders
 * inside it happily — it is markup and links, with no server-only work.
