/**
 * "Also available pre-loved" — the same kind of garment, second-hand, cheaper.
 *
 * ## A cross-sell that runs downward
 *
 * Every other recommendation on a storefront moves a shopper up in price. This
 * one moves them down, on purpose. A shopper looking at a new jean who can have
 * a barely-worn one for a third less is a shopper who buys, and a garment kept
 * in circulation is the whole business — so the cheaper route is the one worth
 * surfacing. It also does the job of introducing the resale side to someone who
 * arrived through the front door and has never opened /pre-loved.
 *
 * ## The saving is the content
 *
 * Each tile leads with what you save, not with the price. "₹1,400 less" is the
 * reason to look; "₹2,650" on its own is just another number next to the one
 * already on the page. The adapter guarantees every item here is strictly
 * cheaper than the garment being viewed, so the figure is never negative and
 * never zero.
 *
 * Condition is shown on every tile. These are second-hand pieces being offered
 * as substitutes for something new, so the grade is the first question a shopper
 * has and hiding it to make the row look cleaner would be the wrong kind of
 * clean.
 *
 * ## It disappears when it has nothing to say
 *
 * No alternatives, no section — not an empty state. A row headed "also available
 * pre-loved" with nothing under it advertises an absence.
