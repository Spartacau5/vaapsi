/**
 * Condition and flaws.
 *
 * **This is a feature, not a formality, and it keeps its design weight.** It is
 * the one thing on this page that is neither specification nor narrative: it is
 * the purchase decision, and it is why the rest of the listing is believable.
 *
 * ## What the density pass changed
 *
 * The information is the same. What went:
 *
 * - **The heading and the grade were saying the same thing twice** — an eyebrow
 *   reading CONDITION over a heading reading "Good", then a paragraph defining
 *   "Good". That is now the meter: the grade, its position on the five-step
 *   scale, and the one-line definition, in the height the heading alone used.
 * - **The inspector's prose was duplicated** into the Product details drawer as
 *   "About this piece". It lives here only. This is where a shopper is looking
 *   when they want it.
 * - **Flaws are a two-column grid** rather than a full-width stacked list, and
 *   each one leads with a location chip. Two flaws used to be two screen-widths
 *   of mostly empty row; they are now one row of two cards.
 *
 * When there are no flaws that is stated explicitly rather than by omission. An
 * empty section reads as "not filled in", and on resale that is the worst
 * possible impression.
