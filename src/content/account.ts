 * The through-line: **you can only sell back something you bought here.** Every
 * string in this file either states that, follows from it, or gets out of its
 * way.
 *
 * That rule is why the resale flow has no sign-up and no listing form. The
 * seller photographs the garment, and the photographs do two jobs at once —
 * they prove it is ours, and they are what the condition and the price are read
 * from. So the copy never asks anyone to "create a listing"; it asks them to
 * show us the thing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The assessment is a demonstration, not a valuation.** There is no model
 * behind it (see `lib/data/resale`). The copy says so where a seller could
 * otherwise reasonably believe a number is a promise, and it never says
 * "AI-powered" as though that were a disclosure.
