 * Two drawers, matching the pattern the client asked for: **Product details**
 * and **Delivery and returns**. Both slide in over the detail column, dim the
 * photograph behind them, and close on Escape or the X.
 *
 * What is *not* in a drawer, deliberately: **condition and flaws**. Prada uses
 * this pattern for specification — fabric, dimensions, product code — which is
 * reference material a shopper consults. On resale, condition is not reference
 * material, it is the purchase decision, and burying it behind a link would
 * undo the reason the rest of the page is trustworthy. It stays on the page.
